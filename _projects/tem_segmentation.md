We implement deep neural nets for instance-based segmentation of axons in TEM images. Our approach studying segmentation of unmyelinated fibers recently published in [1].

Data associated with this study, were collected as part of the Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program and are available through the SPARC Portal (RRID: SCR_017041) under a CC-BY 4.0 license.

All training, testing, and evaluation scripts are hosted in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Banus/umf_unet). Due to large file sizes pretrained models cannot be included in the GitHub package and have to be downloaded from the following link.
