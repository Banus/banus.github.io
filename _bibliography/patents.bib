  abstract = {According to one aspect, a method for determining, for a memory allocation, placements in a memory area of data blocks generated by a neural network, comprises a development of an initial sequence of placements of blocks, each placement being selected from several possible placements, the initial sequence being defined as a candidate sequence, a development of at least one modified sequence of placements from a replacement of a given placement of the initial sequence by a memorized unselected placement, and, if the planned size of the memory area obtained by this modified sequence is less than that of the memory area of the candidate sequence, then this modified sequence becomes the candidate sequence, the placements of the blocks for the allocation being those of the placement sequence defined as a candidate sequence once each modified sequence has been developed.},
