I'm a machine learning and computer vision engineer. I graduated from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/campuses/indianapolis/) with a PhD in Computer Science, under the supervision of [Prof. M. Murat Dundar](https://cs.iupui.edu/~mdundar/). My PhD research focused on developing segmentation models for medical and hyperspectral imagging, with a focus on open-world applications.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as an advanced research engineer at [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) in Italy, where I developed deep learning models with a focus on low-energy devices, such as microcontrollers (MCUs). In there, I helped kickstarting the [Cube.AI](https://stm32ai.st.com/stm32-cube-ai/) project, which at the time was the first tool able to automatically convert neural networks from the most common toolboxes to C code suitable for MCUs.

I graduated from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en) with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I worked on human motion tracking from video sequences under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Marcon](https://marconlab.deib.polimi.it/). I also worked in there as a reasearch assistant on 3D reconstruction and image retrieval methods as part of the [Image and Sound Processing Lab (ISPL)](http://ispl.deib.polimi.it/).
