I'm a machine learning and computer vision engineer. I graduated from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/campuses/indianapolis/) with a PhD in Computer Science, under the supervision of [Prof. M. Murat Dundar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210416141743/http://cs.iupui.edu/~mdundar/). My PhD research focused on developing segmentation models for medical and hyperspectral imaging, with an emphasis on open-world applications.

After my PhD, I joined [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as a Software Development Engineer II in the Alexa Shopping team, where I worked on developing new features for the new LLM-based Alexa+, including deal tracking, automatic purchases based on price conditions, and a new user experience called Shopping Essentials.

Before my PhD, I worked as an advanced research engineer at [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/) in Italy, where I developed deep learning models with a focus on low-energy devices, such as microcontrollers (MCUs). There, I helped kickstart the [Cube.AI](https://stm32ai.st.com/stm32-cube-ai/) project, which at the time was the first tool able to automatically convert neural networks from the most common toolboxes to C code suitable for MCUs.

I graduated from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en) with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I worked on human motion tracking from video sequences under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Marcon](https://marconlab.deib.polimi.it/). I also worked there as a research assistant on 3D reconstruction and image retrieval methods as part of the [Image and Sound Processing Lab (ISPL)](http://ispl.deib.polimi.it/).
